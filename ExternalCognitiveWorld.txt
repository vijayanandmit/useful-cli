1. AI first — structure, clarity, options
2.	 Human second (after 5 min) — judgment, expertise
3.	 Browser last (optional) — fact-check only

Emotional & Social Guardrails

Distance over disrespect
Peace over drama


“Am I seeking resolution — or feeding drama?”

If it’s drama → step back → distance → peace.

Why This Works Long-Term

You’ve now aligned:
	•	Tools (AI, calls, browser)
	•	Attention (listening > looking)
	•	Values (peace, self-respect)
	•	Boundaries (distance as default response)
