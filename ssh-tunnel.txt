Access a web interface (port 9090 on 192.168.216.98) from your local system, but that machine is only reachable from a jump host (172.23.x.255). Here‚Äôs how to do it:

‚úÖ Solution: SSH Local Port Forwarding (via Jump Host)

You can forward the remote port 192.168.216.98:9090 to your local system using:

ssh -L 9090:192.168.216.98:9090 guest@172.23.1.255

üß† What this does:
	‚Ä¢	You SSH into 172.23.1.255.
	‚Ä¢	While connected, it forwards your local machine‚Äôs port 9090 to 192.168.216.98:9090 from the perspective of 172.23.1.255.
	‚Ä¢	You can now open http://localhost:9090 on your browser and it‚Äôll proxy to 192.168.216.98:9090.


‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure:
	‚Ä¢	Port 9090 is open and listening on 192.168.216.98.
	‚Ä¢	172.23.1.255 can reach 192.168.216.98:9090 (as you‚Äôve verified).
	‚Ä¢	If you‚Äôre using a firewall or Cockpit, ensure access is allowed.



Persistent SSH Tunnel Setup

Objective

Access https://192.168.216.98:9090 from your local browser via an SSH tunnel through a jump host (172.23.7.110).

Step 1: Edit SSH Config

Open your terminal and edit the SSH config file:

nano ~/.ssh/config

Add the following block:

Host webpanel
  HostName 172.23.7.110
  User ge-admin
  LocalForward 9090 192.168.216.98:9090

Step 2: Connect Using Shortcut

To establish the tunnel, run:

ssh webpanel

Step 3: Access the Web UI

After connecting, open the following in your browser:

https://localhost:9090

If the remote server enforces HTTPS, you will see the proper interface through the forwarded port.

Optional: Use a Different Local Port

To avoid conflicts or for clarity, you may use a different port like 9900:

  LocalForward 9900 192.168.216.98:9090

Then open:

https://localhost:9900

Optional: Auto-Restart with autossh

For persistent tunnels:

sudo apt install autossh
autossh -M 0 -f -N -T -L 9090:192.168.216.98:9090 ge-admin@172.23.7.110

Notes

Ensure the service is running on the destination IP.

Make sure port 9090 is reachable from the jump host.

Always use https:// if the service enforces TLS.
